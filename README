 dis - distributed twitter substitute hackery

dis is (as of yet?) a commandline utility. Here's an example session:

 $ dis init arthur "Traversing the galaxy, got a towel."
 $ dis post "House demolished. But hey, peanut butter sandwich for breakfast!"
 $ dis post "I'm not sure about this. Not at all."
 $ dis publish
 $ dis track dishes https://github.com/wilhelmtell/dishes.git
 $ dis fetch dishes
 $ dis wut

But of course,

 $ dis help


 DEPENDENCIES

dis depends on git, bash and the GNU coreutils. Here's my setup, on which
things seem to work:

 - Git 1.7.12.4
 - GNU coreutils 8.19
 - Bash 4.2.37
